# Introduction
AIX - The GenAI Rating System is a series of stylistic badges to denote the level of Generative AI involvement in your projects. The system is a simple and concise way, using the honor system of course, to demonstrate how much Generative AI was used in a creative endeavor.

The AIX ratings are designed to be as lenient and forgiving as possible when it comes to the use of AI, as there is a quite a broad range of uses, scenarios, and systems at play. It is not up to me, the consumer, or the ratings themselves to judge, rather it is up to you to be honest about how you created your work. These ratings do not go into detail, but give an "at a glance" overview of what's on offer. I encourage you to still disclose how Generative AI was used, particularly if you'd say a rating of 2 or greater is appropriate for your project.

Similarly, if you are coming here to learn about this rating system, I encourage you to understand that there are nuances to every technology. For instance, a photographer using built-in AI tools in Photoshop to clean up hair is not a demon, and neither is a game developer with express, written permission from actors who've been properly licensed and compensated to use their voices for AI purposes. Please read what each individual creator has to say about their work, and put your pitchforks down if they do not have a speedpaint video, a behind-the-scenes diary, a live edit history, or are unwilling to open source their code for review. Not everyone can take the time to appease the ever-rising requirements of artists to prove their worth.

The publication of the AIX Rating systems does not in turn create any kind of third party board or association to apply ratings to artworks and should not be used for such. They are a Creative Commons artwork and as such you are free to download, use, modify, and sharealike as you wish. See the Usage section below for more information.

# The Ratings
<p>
<b>AI 0 - "No AI Was Used in the Making..."</b><br>
A rating of 0 means that a project includes no generative AI whatsoever, and AI was not actively consulted in its creation. This does not include tidbits of information gleamed from glancing over AI summaries appearing at the top of search engine results, or any other arguably unavoidable but wholly ignored instances of AI use. If your work is handmade, that's all there is to it. If it was made the way things were made before... let's say 2021, then a rating of 0 is appropriate.
<p>
<b>AI 1 - "AI Was Consulted in the Making..."</b><br>
A rating of 1 means AI was actively consulted in the creation of your project. This includes brainstorming or learning from an AI chatbot. This rating also applies to the use of AI tools in specific areas on a project, such as for visual cleanup, for increased pixel resolution (ie upscaling), for making an arduous task easier (for example, UV unwrapping a 3D model), for spellchecking, for project organization, etc. Essentially, if AI tools were used in a project, but all the work seen or heard is handmade, a rating of 1 is appropriate.
<p>
<b>AI 2 - "...Includes Some AI Generation."</b><br>
A rating of 2 means that some machine-made art, sound, words, or concepts are present in the work. This can include AI generated artwork, music, code, or dialogue which is subsidizing primarily handmade work. This rating is appropriate if you have, for example, localized your project into various langauges using AI; if you have some AI-voiced characters; if you have an AI generated filter over your video to give it a different look; if you've used AI to autotune your singing, create a backing track, or create remixes of your songs; or you have some visuals, sounds, music, or dialogue in your work which have been AI generated. A rating of 2 is appropriate for most projects that have some AI present in the work, or that the work was achieved with some help from AI tools, but ultimately makes up less than half of what's on offer.
<p>
<b>AI 3 - "... Is Mostly AI Generated."</b><br>
A rating of 3 means that the work is mostly the result of Generative AI, with significant, handmade tweaks or human craftsmanship used to put the work together. For instance, a videogame might have a rating of 3 if nearly all the visuals and music are AI generated, but the code was written by a human, or if the software was fully vibe-coded but everything else was hand-crafted. A song might have a rating of 3 if all the instrumental parts were AI generated, but the words were written and sung by a human. A book might have a rating of 3 if a person wrote the story but an AI created all the illustrations. A rating of 3 is appropriate for projects where about half or more (but less than all) of the work was done by an AI.
<p>
<b>AI X - "... Is AI Generated."</b><br>
A rating of X means the project is 90-100% AI generated, top to bottom. A human may have written the prompt, but even this is questionable. For instance, a videogame which includes 100% AI generated design, art, sound, and code would get a rating of X, even if the resulting pieces were put together manually in a game engine. Similarly, a video created using 100% AI generated shots would get a rating of X, even if it was manually edited together. Music would get a rating of X if the instrumentation and words were written by a machine, even if the words were sung by a human. A magazine article would get a rating of X is the words and photographs used were both AI generated. Interestingly, the output of an AI tool to determine if something was created by AI would constitute a rating of X, but would not affect the original work's rating. A rating of X is appropriate for any creation, be it film, video, image, song, story, news article, research paper, etc. created strictly using prompts, rather than by traditional means, and work done by a human, if any, only subsidized the generated work.

# Using the Ratings
AIX - The Generative AI Rating System and the ratings within are Creative Commons Non-Commercial Sharealike. You are free to use these ratings or modify them in your own works. I have chosen this license specifically because the ratings themselves aren't for sale and are not meant to be sold. But make no mistake, you can, and SHOULD, apply an appropriate rating in your commercial projects, preferably in the credits, description, or readme file.

The included ZIP has SVG vector files, as well as PNG's appropriate for screens and for printing. Each rating has 11 different variations for Artwork, Films, Games, Videos, Music, Software, Websites, Books, Papers, Reports, and Articles for your convenience, but you are free to modify these to fit your specific needs too.

# FAQ
<b>Q: Should I change my rating if my work was altered by an AI without my consent? For instance, YouTube upscaling shorts for mobile.</b><br>
A: No! Ratings are based on what you PUT into your work, not what a platform or someone else did with your work without your consent.
<p>
<b>Q: I didn't use any AI in my creation and a scan still said I did! What do I do?</b><br>
A: Unfortunately this rating system cannot help you with such situations. However, this is the one exception I'm happy to make to the "these ratings are for you to rate your own creations" rule. Since it is ironically AI tools that determine if something was made by AI, and these have an accuracy about as good as a Stormtrooper, feel free to slap a sticker of an AIX Rating on the printed scan and hand it back.

# Get Involved
This is an ongoing project and will receive updates as needed. The ratings are in desperate need of translation, preferably better than what Google Translate or a chatbot could do, so if you would like to take this on you can send translations my way or fork the project into your own language! If you have other ideas for the ratings, I am very open to feedback and will see what I can do.
