## Introduction
The AIX Rating System is a series of stylistic badges to denote the level of Generative AI involvement in your projects. The system is a simple and concise way, using the honor system of course, to demonstrate how much Generative AI was used in a creative endeavor.

These ratings are designed to be as lenient and forgiving as possible when it comes to the use of AI, as there is a quite a broad range of uses, scenarios, and systems at play. It is not up to me or the ratings themselves to judge, rather it is up to you to be honest about how you created your work. These ratings do not go into detail, but give an "at a glance" overview of what's on offer. I encourage you to still disclose how Generative AI was used, particularly if you'd say a rating of 2 or greater is appropriate for your project.

Similarly, if you are coming here to learn about this rating system, I encourage you to understand that there are nuances to every technology. For instance, a photographer using built-in AI tools in Photoshop to clean up hair is not a demon, and neither is a game developer with express, written permission from actors who've been properly compensated to use their voices for AI purposes. Please read what each individual creator has to say about their work, and put your pitchforks down if they do not have a speedpaint video, a behind-the-scenes diary, a live edit history, or are unwilling to open source their code for review. Not everyone can take the time to appease the ever-rising requirements of artists to prove their worth.

## The Ratings
<b>AI 0</b> - A rating of 0 means that a project includes no generative AI whatsoever, and AI was not actively consulted in its creation. This does not include tidbits of information gleamed from glancing over AI summaries appearing at the top of search engine results, or any other arguably unavoidable but wholly ignored instances of AI use. If your work is handmade, that's all there is to it. If it was made the way things were made before... let's say 2021, then a rating of 0 is appropriate.

<b>AI 1</b> - A rating of 1 means AI was actively consulted in the creation of your project. This includes brainstorming or learning from an AI chatbot. This rating also applies to the use of AI tools in specific areas on a project, such as for visual cleanup, for increased pixel resolution (ie upscaling), for making an arduous task easier (for example, UV unwrapping a 3D model), for spellchecking, for project organization, etc. Essentially, if AI was used in a project, but all the work seen or heard is handmade, a rating of 1 is appropriate.

<b>AI 2</b> - A rating of 2 means that some machine-made art, sound, words, or concepts are present in the work. This can include AI generated artwork, music, code, or dialogue which is subsidizing primarily handmade work. This rating is appropriate if you have, for example, localized your project into various langauges using AI; if you have some AI-voiced characters; if you have an AI generated filter over your video to give it a different look; if you've used AI to create remixes of your songs; or you have some visuals, sounds, music, or dialogue which have been AI generated. A rating of 2 is appropriate for most projects that say they have some AI present in the work or that the work was achieved with the help of AI.

<b>AI 3</b> - A rating of 3 means that the work is mostly the result of Generative AI, with significant, handmade tweaks or human craftsmanship used to put the work together. For instance, a videogame might have a rating of 3 if nearly all the visuals and music are AI generated, but the code was written by a human, or even vice versa. A song might have a rating of 3 if all the instrumental parts were AI generated, but the words were written and sung by a human. A book might have a rating of 3 if a person wrote the story but an AI created all the illustrations. A rating of 3 is appropriate for projects where about half or more (but less than all) of the work was done by an AI, but it would not have come together without the help of human intelligence and creativity.

<b>AI X</b> - A rating of X means the project is 90-100% AI generated, top to bottom. A human may have written the prompt, but even this is questionable. For instance, a videogame which includes 100% AI generated design, art, sound, and code would get a rating of X, even if the resulting pieces were put together manually in a game engine. Similarly, a video created using 100% AI generated shots would get a rating of X, even if it was manually edited together. A rating of X is appropriate for any creation, be it film, video, image, song, story, news article, research paper, etc. created strictly using prompts, rather than by traditional means, and any work done by a human subsidized the generated work.

# Using the Ratings
These ratings are Creative Commons Non-Commercial Sharealike and you are free to use them or modify them in your own works. The ZIP file includes SVG and Adobe Illustrator vector files, as well as PNG's appropriate for screens and for printing. Each rating has 10 different variations for Artwork, Films, Games, Videos, Music, Software, Websites, Books, Papers, and Reports for your convenience, but you are free to modify these to fit your specific needs too!
